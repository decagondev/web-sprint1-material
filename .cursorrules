# Cursor Rules for Web Unit 1 Sprint 1 Course Content Site Implementation

## Follow the Plan Strictly
- Always refer to plan.md for the implementation steps
- Complete each step in the defined order
- Check off items in the plan as they are completed
- Do not skip steps or add unplanned features

## File Structure and Naming
- Create only the index.html file as specified
- Do not create additional HTML, CSS, or JS files
- Use inline JavaScript for the theme toggle functionality
- Use the Tailwind CSS CDN for styling

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling
- Follow the color scheme defined in the plan
- Ensure dark/light theme compatibility for all elements
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

## Content Implementation
- Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, section, article, etc.)
- Structure content according to the module organization
- Link to wiki_content files using relative paths
- Include proper alt text for all images

## Code Quality
- Use descriptive class names when necessary (beyond Tailwind utilities)
- Keep JavaScript minimal and focused on core functionality
- Add comments for complex sections
- Format code consistently with proper indentation

## Accessibility
- Include proper ARIA attributes where appropriate
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios
- Ensure keyboard navigability
- Use semantic HTML to enhance screen reader compatibility

## Performance
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Optimize any images before inclusion
- Avoid unnecessary JavaScript
- Use responsive Tailwind classes instead of media queries when possible

## Testing
- Test all links before considering implementation complete
- Verify theme toggle works as expected
- Check responsiveness at multiple screen sizes
- Validate HTML with W3C validator
