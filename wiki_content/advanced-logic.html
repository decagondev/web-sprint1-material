<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>The best apps take data and turn it into new, more valuable data. For example, a GPS app will take your starting and ending location and produce a new route between those two points. Before GPS could leverage this data, it was a developer's job (i.e., you) to build the code.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to build new data is <strong>by combining multiple truthy and falsy</strong> values into one. Surprisingly, combining these values is one of the most commonly used tactics in coding and is something you will do throughout your developer journey.</p>
<p><strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong> operators are the most common tools in combining truthy and falsy values. You will learn how these operators work and how to use them correctly. We'll also show some more advanced examples to help you see how far truthy and falsy values can take us.</p>
<p>Side-note: itâ€™s important to point out that <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong> work differently in JavaScript due to truthy and falsy values. Make sure you pick up on the nuances, or else, you may find yourself in disbelief when your code produces a string instead of a Boolean value.</p>

<p><span>Before reading on, make sure you have gone over&nbsp;</span><strong>comparisons</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>falsiness</strong><span>. Advanced logic uses these two topics heavily. We recommend reading this section first to see if that helps solidify your understanding before reviewing past material.</span></p>

<h3>Case Study: Viking Runners</h3>
<p><span>Viking Runners' check-in process ensures teams have all of their documents, team members, and race status accounted for before they start the 24-hour race. The system currently considers single values, but it needs a more sophisticated solution when considering multiple variables. As you learn about more complex conditionals, you will also see how to leverage multiple variables to make the Viking Runners' check-in process more streamlined.</span></p>
