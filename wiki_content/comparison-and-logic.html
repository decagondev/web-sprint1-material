<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>A typical tool career counselors give to their clients is an aptitude test, or skills test, which gives them some indication of which career fields their client might initially find success in. Inevitably, these tests utilize a lot of comparative logic: “if this… then that” or “if this and this… then that instead”, and so on. Comparative expressions such as these, help construct a profile of an individual’s strengths and weaknesses and then determine some best-fit careers based on that profile. For example, if a person tests at a high level in interpersonal skills but low in analysis, then they might suggest a teacher but not a psychologist; whereas, if a person tests well in mathematics but not leadership, then they might suggest an engineer, but not a project manager.</p>
<p>Although an aptitude test like this is an obvious example of something that uses comparative logic, you will find that every program that you develop will need comparative logic to function.</p>
<p>This reading will cover all the fundamental operators used to make logical comparisons of values in Javascript, and how we can combine multiple operators to build more complex comparisons.</p>

<h3>Case Study:&nbsp;<span>Washington CC</span></h3>
<p><span>It is our final case study involving your role as a software engineering instructor at Washington CC. You have spent quite a few days introducing your students to the important tools, values, and variables you will use when developing your website on active clubs found at the school. We have already encountered a few scenarios, such as determining when a user is logged in and whether a club has reached its total member capacity. These would be good candidates to introduce comparative logic, and we will see how this works in the upcoming learning objectives.</span></p>
