<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>When a program runs, its execution does not follow a preordained path. This same thing happens in life. Perhaps you like walking in the morning, but only if the day is sunny. Otherwise, you prefer to stay home reading. There is a point where a logical choice is made, and this logic determines what happens next.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can create multiple outcomes in programs by telling our code to do something different if a condition is met. These are simply called <strong>conditional statements</strong>. Conditional statements determine if a code block should be executed based on if a statement is true or false. For example, if a program that uploads images receives an image file, then the file should be uploaded. However, if the file is a text file, the program will show an error message.</p>
<p>In this reading, you will learn how to write a conditional statement, how to test multiple conditions, and how to chain conditional statements. The fact that a program can behave differently depending on conditions is a big part of what makes it feel dynamic and powerful. We will use <code>if</code> statements in most -if not all- programs in our professional life.</p>
<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Familiarize yourself with falsiness and advanced boolean logic. Conditionals will rely on both of these concepts throughout this reading.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Viking Runners</h3>
<p>Viking Runners has seen significant progress with the system you've built to determine if teams qualify to race. Now they want the system to inform teams when they are not qualified so the teams can fix their issues before the race. Thankfully, you'll be learning about conditionals which will let you update the system to perform actions if certain criteria are not met.</p>
