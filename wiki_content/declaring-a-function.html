<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p><strong>Functions</strong> are one of Javascript’s most fundamental building blocks on par with variables. To many, they are a crowd favorite because functions perform actions: they help create new values and structures and update old ones.</p>
<p>Functions operate a lot like scientific experiments. Take, for instance, the classic elementary experiment in which “lava” erupts from a volcano model. In this example, you first need materials, such as baking soda and vinegar (and maybe some orange food coloring). Then you run a series of actions, like combining the baking soda and vinegar. The result? A chemical reaction that causes the volcano to erupt!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Functions operate similarly: they usually start with an input, perform some step-by-step action involving that input, and return a new output. In other words, functions are a means for software developers to take old values or structures and create new valuable ones.</p>
<p>In this reading, you will learn how to write a function in its most basic format and run, or “invoke”, a function. You will also start learning about scope, which tells us which variables may and may not be accessible to the functions we write.</p>
<h4>Why Use Functions?</h4>
<p>In the end, functions execute a block of code to manipulate data and perform an action. So why must you "encapsulate" this code inside a function? Well, you don't, but by using functions, you will gain a lot of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions are declared only once in your code and can be invoked multiple times when needed. This is re-usable code in practice and prevents you from rewriting repetitive code;</li>
<li><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Your code will be easier to write, read, and maintain. As a developer, you will be able to concentrate your efforts on a particular action (function) without worrying about other parts of the application;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">By designing what a function should receive (data to be manipulated) and what it is supposed to accomplish, you can defer the actual implementation of the function for a later phase in development and continue with your main code.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">As long as you know what kind of data you are supposed to pass for a function and what data will be returned by the function, you can "import" and use existing functions designed by other developers without caring about their actual implementation.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Case Study:&nbsp;Discovering Oceana</h3>
<p><span>Continuing with our analogy involving scientific experimentation, you are an emerging software developer for a marine biological research lab called “Discovering Oceana.” Established in 2017, this research lab focuses on advancing techniques to best protect marine species that live near large human populations. Your task is to write a few functions that will help manage the data of their ongoing research on how well species survive in these regions.</span></p>
