<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>Booleans that are either true or false exist in nearly every programing language, but JavaScript goes a step further by allowing other values to represent true or false. We describe these values as “truthy” or “falsy”. The terms “truthy” and “falsy” are industry terms, you will use them both in this course and throughout your career, so it is important to understand how these terms are applied.</p>
<p>This section will cover truthy, falsy and we will introduce the not <strong>(!)</strong> operator. The not operator allows us to achieve the opposite Boolean equivalent of a truthy or falsy value. Getting the opposite of a truthy and falsy value has many applications in coding.</p>
<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
<p><span>You will need to understand values, variables, and comparisons to best grasp this material. If you feel a review of these concepts would be useful, return to their respective modules before reading on.</span></p>

<h3>Case Study: Viking Runners</h3>
<p><span>Throughout this module, you will see code examples for the nonprofit Viking Runners. Viking Runners organizes team relay races where runners complete different parts of the race path over 24 hours. Before each race, each team must go through a thorough check-in process with a race coordinator. This process is time-consuming when done manually and is prone to error, so a system is being built to ensure the race coordinators are checking in each team correctly. As you read through how to this module, you will address various requirements regarding this check-in process in the code examples.</span></p>
