    <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
    <p>So far, we have treated functions as both the modifiers and creators of information, declaring variables and setting values specifically for the function’s purpose. In reality, this is not usually the case, but it can be. Under most circumstances, functions will need to take in some raw information, also known as “input,” before carrying out their function to modify it.</p>
    <p>In this way, functions can be much like artists who require some medium or raw material to carry out their artistic processes. A sculpture needs clay; a painter needs paint and a brush, etc. In the same way, many functions need raw information that they can, in turn, modify to make a useful output for the entire program.</p>
    <p>In this reading, you will learn just how to use inputs, better known as “arguments”, for functions, and how those arguments determine the unique outputs of that function.</p>

    <p><span>Continuing with our case study on the “Discovering Oceana” marine research lab, your next task as the software engineer is to write some functions that allow them to use custom arguments to help them document species’ locations.</span></p>
