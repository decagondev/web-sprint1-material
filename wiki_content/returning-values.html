    <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
    <p>When developing an application, functions support an application's much larger flow or purpose. Functions help organize code and allow code to be reused in various parts of an application. But functions can provide so much more value. One of the essential configurations for a function is for it to return a value that the rest of the application can use.</p>
    <p>The importance of functions returning a value, better known as a "return value," is much like the importance of repairing products that you would like to use again. Say you would like to see the latest comedy movie with your favorite comedian. You go up to a kiosk to buy your ticket, and you give the kiosk your money. The kiosk has a function that processes the payment and returns a ticket. But what if the kiosk just took your money and didn't return a ticket? At the very least, you would think you're dealing with a broken kiosk. The process of buying a ticket means you expect a specific output: the ticket itself. Thankfully, the kiosk shoots out the ticket, and you enjoy your movie, laughing the whole time.</p>
    <p>In the same way, functions can produce helpful values for the application. In this reading, you will learn about how we can configure our functions to return a value, rather than only perform a list of actions.</p>

    <h3>Case Study:&nbsp;Discovering Oceana</h3>
    <p><span>We'll return to our case study from the last core competency where you work as a software engineer for the marine research lab "Discovering Oceana". Allowing your prior functions to print important values to the console worked well to help them track errors and slow processing times, but now it is time to upgrade your functions to return important values needed to better inform their research.</span></p>
