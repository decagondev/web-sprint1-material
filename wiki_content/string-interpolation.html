<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>Like numbers, booleans, and a few others, strings are one of the most fundamental primitives used in Javascript. As a software developer, there will not be a day that goes by without working with strings. Strings constantly need to be created, evaluated, and edited for countless reasons in the context of any web application.</p>
<p>So far, we have learned how to write strings, store them in variables, and concatenate multiple strings and/or variables using the + sign, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens if not more, actions that you can do with strings to better use them for different software application purposes.</p>
<p>This reading will focus on three of the most commonly used ways to work with strings: finding their length, referencing indices (or positions) of characters in the string, and efficiently linking strings and variables into one long string.</p>

<h3>Case Study:&nbsp;Discovering Oceana</h3>
<p><span>Numbers mean everything to the marine research lab “Discovering Oceana”, but what are numbers without strings that explain them? The focus of this case study will be working with strings to help the research team better organize the data they have collected so far about their marine species.</span></p>
