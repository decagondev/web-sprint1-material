    <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
    <p>In this module, we will detour from Javascript and introduce the most fundamental document that determines which elements and content to display on a website's screen — the HTML document.</p>
    <p>Before we jump into the details of HTML, let us remind ourselves of the big picture of how HTML, Javascript, and CSS all work together to form a web application. How these three interact is comparable to a basic sentence's structure. Take, for instance, the simple sentence:</p>
    <p>"The blue dog barks."</p>
    <p>This sentence contains a noun, verb, and adjective. Nouns, like "dog," resemble HTML elements: the items or content you see on the screen. Verbs define the action, like how the dog "barks," are like the Javascript code that can manipulate, add, or delete any HTML element. Finally, the adjectives, which describe the nouns, resemble the CSS markup used to stylize HTML elements to make them look a certain way (like "blue" does to "dog"). All three parts together: HTML, Javascript, and CSS, help form what you see and interact with on a web application.</p>
    <p>But no matter how you look at it, every action or stylization on a webpage ultimately needs HTML. That is why we say the HTML document is the most fundamental document to a web application. Without it, you have nothing; without the others, you still have elements on the page (albeit static and boring).</p>
    <p>In this reading, you will learn about the basic anatomy of an HTML document and how that anatomy is used and structured.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Digital Newsday</h3>
    <p><span>Digital news outlets have all but replaced newspapers these days. You have been hired by a startup, online-based news outlet, “Digital Newsday”, looking for someone to put the starting touches on their new web application. Given the complex structure of many current news websites, you will have your hands full in constructing an HTML markup that best displays headlines, articles, navigation links, and more. But the public needs you! According to Digital Newsday’s mission, they represent human, heartfelt news in a world that is over-cluttered by superficial news.</span></p>
