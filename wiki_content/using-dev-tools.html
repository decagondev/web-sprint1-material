    <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
    <p>By far, the most useful collection of tools web developers use to understand exactly how the browser is rendering their program are the Chrome development tools, or “dev tools” for short. Virtually useless and unknown to the common web surfer, the Chrome dev tools are essential to the daily work of a web developer. They allow the web developer to pinpoint exactly how the browser reads their program’s HTML markup, Javascript code, CSS styles, console, HTTP requests, and much more.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it is best to think of the dev tools as a comprehensive diagnostic program always running alongside your web application. For teachers, it’s much like having the lesson plan, a video of the lesson itself, and reflections from all the students on how the lesson went, all in one go.</p>
    <p>Since the dev tools are so crucial to the daily work of web developers, we thought it best to at least introduce them here. In this reading, you will learn how to access the Chrome dev tools, navigate some of its features, and manipulate some of its content.</p>

    <h3>Case Study: Digital Newsday</h3>
    <p><span>You have made great strides laying down some of the initial HTML markup for your “Digital Newsday” web application. A web designer specializing in designing the look of the website, not building it, has recently informed you of some initial content and styles they would like you to try for the “list items” in the navigation you have already created. Instead of re-editing your HTML code, this task would be excellent for Chrome development tools that can manipulate content and styling.</span></p>
