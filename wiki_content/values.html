<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>Boiled down to its simplest parts, Javascript is all about values:&nbsp;creating them,&nbsp;storing them,&nbsp;updating them,&nbsp;moving them,&nbsp;utilizing them, and even,&nbsp;forgetting them.</p>
<p>They are much like the cells of the human body, each having their own identity and purpose. But, when you get enough of them together performing the same function as muscle cells would pump blood in the heart, they take on a newer, more prominent sense of purpose that can make an application shine. Though, in the end, if you break it down, all that remains are <strong>values.</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of values used in Javascript, each with their own pros and cons, all of which we will cover in due time.</p>
<p>In this reading, we will focus on some of the most fundamental values, better known as primitive types, and introduce some ways we can use them.</p>
<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<h3>Case Study:&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span>What is web development without Javascript, the language that controls the logic of it all? It is time for us to return to the project you are creating for your software engineering students at Washington Community Center. So far, you have done great work setting up the HTML file your students will use to start building their schoolâ€™s website on available clubs and logging the information for some of those clubs in the console. Now it is time to work with some of the value types needed for this project: strings, numbers, booleans, and even, undefined.</span></p>
