<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>In our last core competency, we discussed how the nuts and bolts of web development work with values. But using values only as standalone items would require a developer to edit code each time a user wanted to change anything on the website, like changing one’s status on a profile page. Thus, perhaps the most convenient thing you can do with values is to store them where they can be easily accessed and modified in other parts of the program.</p>
<p><strong>In Javascript, any value type can be stored in something called a variable. </strong>Think of a variable as a type of container, specifically a food container. A food container can be manufactured and continue to exist without food; so can variables without values. But the intention of manufacturing food containers is to hold food, same with variables and values. Furthermore, some food containers are designed for one-time use, like zip-lock bags (mostly). Other food containers, like tupperware, are designed to be used multiple times for multiple types of food. In the same way, we have variables in Javascript that can only hold one value, period. While others are designed to hold multiple values at once, and even others are designed to hold multiple values too, albeit one at a time.</p>
<p>In this reading, you will learn how to create variables in Javascript and how to give those variables values. You will also learn which types of variables can be changed and how to go about changing them.</p>

<h3>Case Study: <span>Washington CC Clubs</span></h3>
<p><span>We are embarking on the third leg of our case study where you are a recently hired software engineering teacher at Washington Community Center. You and your students have been putting the early touches on your new web application that will eventually list all the current student clubs at Washington CC and information about each club’s meeting times and location, as well as, member capacity. We have done a deep dive into exploring the types of values that we would expect to see when developing such a project: strings, numbers, booleans, and even, undefined values. It is now time to finally make those values more accessible to the rest of the application by storing them in variables that can either be referenced later or updated.</span></p>
