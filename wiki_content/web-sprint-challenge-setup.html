<h3><strong>Welcome to the Sprint Challenge Setup</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>This section describes how to obtain your copy of the Challenge, and how to submit it for automated grading after having completed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also learn how to approach the problems in your Challenge, specifically how to manually test your code and troubleshoot problems, as well as useful tips and tricks for getting unblocked if you encounter a particularly difficult problem.</p>

<h3><strong>Asking for Help: Strategies &amp; Guidelines</strong></h3>
</div>
<h4><strong>1. The 20-Minute Rule</strong></h4>
<p><span>Before reaching out for help, try to solve the problem on your own for at least 20 minutes. This allows you to deeply engage with the issue and potentially find a solution independently. However, if after 20 minutes you're still stuck, it's time to ask for assistance.</span></p>
<h4><strong>2. Using UPER for Problem Solving</strong></h4>
<p><span>At the start of any problem, you may find it beneficial to go through the UPER process:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand:</strong><span> Identify the parts of the problem you do understand and what you don’t understand. A way to find out if you understand the problem is if you can explain the problem in your own words. Make a note of what you don’t understand and seek clarification before moving on.</span><span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong><span> With the problem understood, now plan to solve it. Don’t code anything at this point. Use pseudo-code or write out the solution like you were explaining it to a peer. You may find that there’s something about the problem you don’t understand, and that’s okay. Seek to understand that part of the problem before moving on.&nbsp;</span><span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Execute:</strong><span> Put your plan into action! This means coding, debugging, and testing your approach.</span><span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Review:</strong><span> Look back at your attempt. What worked? What didn't? Can you identify where you might be going wrong? Go back to one of the previous steps and repeat the process. Perhaps you found an issue that needs clarification, or maybe you overlooked something in your plan. That always happens to software engineers, so you’re in good company.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Walking through UPER can help clarify where you need assistance and make the help you receive more effective.</span></p>
<h4><strong>3. Contacting Learning Assistants (LAs)</strong></h4>
<p><span>If you've utilized the 20-minute rule and the UPER approach but still need assistance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Check the </span><a href="https://help.bloomtech.com/"><span>Help Hub</span></a><span> for articles on the problem you facing. We post articles based on the types of questions we get from learners, so it’s possible the problem you having has already been solved and posted there.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Chat with our LearnBot inside of Canvas. The Bot knows all the curriculum and is built specifically to help BloomTech learners.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Chat with an LA via </span><a href="https://app.bloomtech.com/"><span>the Portal</span></a><span>. LAs are available most of the day and are there to help you work through the problems you are having.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If you notice an issue with the curriculum (broken links, unclear instructions, etc), </span><a href="https://help.bloomtech.com/contact-us##search_query=portal"><span>submit a ticket</span></a><span>. Our support team will step in and help resolve the issue.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>When you ask for help, please include what you understand about the problem and what step of the UPER process you're on so the LearnBot or a Learning Assistant can tailor their assistance accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Remember: </strong>It's okay to ask for help! Everyone learns at their own pace, and we're here to support you on your coding journey. It's part of the learning process to encounter challenges, but how you approach them makes all the difference.</span></p>
