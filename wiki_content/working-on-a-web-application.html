<p><span>Welcome to your first core competency at BloomTech, and congratulations on taking the next step in your professional software engineer journey! Before we dive into learning Javascript, we are going to learn about some technologies and tools we will use throughout the course.</span></p>
<p>In an industry that can be so much in flux, it is important to have something stable, something that steadily grows no matter the circumstances, which is why we suggest, you always remain curious. Unlike many other professions, software engineering is a very dynamic field that may look very different from one job to the next, or from one person to the next, or even one day to the next.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In this reading, you will become familiar with the essential skills of opening and editing coding files. Step-by-step set-up instructions are provided so you have all the tools available to learn here at BloomTech. By the end of this segment, you will be able to:&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Case Study:&nbsp;<span>Washington Community Center</span></h3>
<p><span>Welcome to your first Case Study! Throughout Module 1, we will be working alongside a Community Center, Washington CC where you have been hired as a software engineering teacher. Throughout this module, there will be different tasks and different asks. Follow up with some practice and you will be one step closer to becoming a professional!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lesson Plans: You are drafting the lesson plans for the first week of classes, which will primarily expose some of the files and tools they will need for the remainder of the course. It is important to not only introduce them to a HTML file but also to show them how that file can be managed and manipulated in a code editor.</span></p>
